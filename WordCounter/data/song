Someday, I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard, then
They're gluing in roses on a flatbed
You should see it
I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches and the door frames
I don't know when you got taller
See your reflection in the water
Off the bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew
What I wanted
And when I grow up
I'm gonna look up from my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like
My recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns in to a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room
Like a hedge maze
And when I find you, you touch my leg
And I insist
But I wake up before we do it
I don't know how but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
And she told me my resentments getting smaller
No I'm not afraid of hard work
And I did everything I want
I have everything I wanted
